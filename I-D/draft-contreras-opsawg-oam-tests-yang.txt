A YANG Data Model for the Management of Operations, Administration, and
                        Maintenance (OAM) Tests
                draft-contreras-opsawg-oam-tests-yang-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for representing the view of
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tests that are part
   of a Service Provider network.  The data model augments ietf-network
   model by adding the concept of oam-test.  The OAM Test concept is a
   OAM test instance with its life cycle, which relies on OAM node
   models.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tasks are
   fundamental functionalities of the network management.  Given the
   emerging of data models and their utilization in Service Provider's
   management, the management of OAM tests has also to be defined as a
   data model.

   Network operator can use OAM tests for the following use cases: *
   One-time on-demand validation tasks.  For example, after a service is
   created, the network operator can create a birth certificate
   obtaining network parameters (latency, losses or bandwidth) +
   Proactive supervision tasks in the network.  The network operators
   can perform continuous monitoring activities to detect, for example,
   SLA violations on an existing service. + Troubleshooting.  After the
   detection of a problem in the network, OAM tests are performed to
   find the root cause for the detected issue. - Network Optimization.
   Delay and loss metrics are monitored in the network to perform
   automated traffic optimization actions like LSP rerouting.

   [RFC7276] presents an overview of OAM tools, summarizes some of the
   tools for performance monitoring and detecting network failures.
   [RFC8531] defines a technology-independent YANG model including the
   key OAM information for the connection-oriented protocols.  It uses
   the concepts of the CFM model as a basis, but it enables the

   adaptation to other connection-oriented OAM protocols.  Similarly,
   [RFC8532] works in a a technology-independent YANG model, but for the
   connectionless protocols.  [RFC8533] defines presents an on-demand
   retrieval method YANG data model for conectionless OAM protocols.

   For the use cases presented in this section,

   An OAM test is an execution of a test that an operator want to do in
   its network.  The OAM test as itself has a life cycle, inputs and
   outputs.  There are two major OAM modes: on-demand and periodic.
   "On-demand" tests are executed once after they are configured in the
   node.  On the other hand, "periodic" tests are those that are
   configured once, but they are executed several times.  An OAM test
   executed in two different moments will provide different outcomes.

   An OAM test-sequence is a set of OAM contains a set of OAM tests
   which are executed in parallel or sequential stages providing test
   grouping mechanisms.  An OAM test-sequence will have aggregate
   results, providing a summary of the test results associated with this
   OAM test-sequence.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC7276], [RFC8531], [RFC8532], and [RFC8533].  The document uses
   terms from those documents.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

   Following terms are used for the representation of this data model.

   OAM test:

      a device installed on one or several shelves and can afford some
      specific transmission function independently.

   OAM test-sequence:

      a holder of the device and provides power supply for the device in
      it.

1.2.  Tree Diagram

   Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data
   model is used in Section 3 of this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

                 +========+=================+===========+
                 | Prefix | Yang Module     | Reference |
                 +========+=================+===========+
